# Raseed App Requirements

## High-Level Goals
- Implement a multi-screen Flutter application for receipt management and spending analysis, based on the provided UI designs.
- The visual design, layout, fonts, colors, and icons should precisely match the reference image.
- Implement navigation between the main screens using a bottom navigation bar.

## Screen Specifications

### 1. Receipt Capture & Confirmation Screen
- **Trigger:** This screen should appear when a dedicated camera/capture button is pressed.
- **UI:**
    - Display a preview of a receipt (a static image can be used for now).
    - Show an overlay with extracted details:
        - Vendor: (e.g., "STORE")
        - Date: (e.g., "04/22/2024")
        - Amount: (e.g., "$17.27")
    - A "CONFIRM" button.
- **Functionality:**
    - Clicking "CONFIRM" should simulate saving the receipt and navigate the user to the Dashboard. No actual data processing is required yet.

### 2. Dashboard Screen (Home)
- **Navigation:** This is the main screen, accessible via the "Home" icon on the bottom navigation bar.
- **UI Components:**
    - **Title:** "Dashboard".
    - **Summary Cards:** Three horizontal cards for "Daily Spend", "Week-to-Date", and "Month-to-Date".
    - **Spending Chart:** A line graph displaying spending trends with toggles for 7d, 30d, and 90d views. Use static data for the chart.
    - **Information Panels:**
        - "Recent Expenses": Shows the last transaction.
        - "Spending Breakdown": Shows the top spending category.
        - "Budget Limit": A warning about exceeding the budget.

### 3. Categorized Expenses Screen
- **Navigation:** Accessed via the second icon (graph) on the bottom navigation bar.
- **UI Components:**
    - **Title:** "Categorized Expenses".
    - **Category Grid:** A 2x2 grid displaying expense categories.
    - **Category Card:** Each card in the grid should contain an icon, category name, total amount spent, and a circular progress indicator.

### 4. Budget Analysis Screen
- **Navigation:** Accessed via the third icon (dollar sign) on the bottom navigation bar.
- **UI Components:**
    - **View Toggle:** Buttons to switch between "By Amount" and "By Frequency".
    - **Budget Donut Chart:** A large circular chart displaying the "Total Budget" and segments for different spending categories.
    - **Suggestion Card:** A card with a piggy bank icon and a message like "Reduce your spending".

### 5. Transaction History Screen
- **Navigation:** This screen is shown in the designs but is not represented in the bottom navigation bar. It could be accessed by tapping on the "Recent Expenses" panel in the Dashboard.
- **UI Components:**
    - **Search Bar:** A search input field at the top.
    - **Transaction List:** Grouped by month ("April", "March"), with each item showing an icon, merchant name, category, and amount.

## Global Components

### Bottom Navigation Bar
- **Icons:** Implement a bottom navigation bar with four icons:
    1.  **Home:** Navigates to the Dashboard.
    2.  **Graph:** Navigates to Categorized Expenses.
    3.  **Dollar Sign:** Navigates to Budget Analysis.
    4.  **Settings (Gear):** This screen is not designed. Create a placeholder page for it.
- **Functionality:** The bar should allow seamless switching between the main screens.

## Asset Requirements
- All UI elements must match the provided image.
- Use placeholder data for all dynamic content (charts, lists, amounts) for the initial implementation.
