# Gemini Project Analysis: raseed

## Overview

This is a new Flutter project named "raseed". It was generated using the standard `flutter create` command and has not been significantly modified. The project is a simple counter application, which is the default template provided by Flutter.

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard Flutter directory structure, with separate directories for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, web, and Windows builds. The main application code is located in `lib/main.dart`.

## Key Files

*   **`pubspec.yaml`**: Defines the project's metadata and dependencies.
    *   **Dependencies**: `flutter`, `cupertino_icons`
    *   **Dev Dependencies**: `flutter_test`, `flutter_lints`
*   **`lib/main.dart`**: The main entry point of the application. It contains the code for the default counter app.
*   **`test/widget_test.dart`**: Contains a basic widget test that verifies the functionality of the counter.
*   **`README.md`**: The default README file generated by Flutter.

## Functionality

The application consists of a single screen with a counter that increments every time the user taps the floating action button.

## How to Run

To run the application, use the following command in the project's root directory:

```bash
flutter run
```

## How to Test

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
flutter test
```

## Pending Items

### High Priority:

*   **Chat Functionality:**
    *   **API Integration:** The chat screen is currently using a simulated bot response. You need to replace this with a real API call to your bot's backend. The relevant code is in `lib/screens/chat_screen.dart` in the `_getBotResponse` method.
    *   **"Typing" Indicator:** The "typing" indicator is not being removed correctly. You need to fix the logic in `lib/providers/chat_provider.dart` to correctly identify and remove the typing message.
*   **Receipt Capture:**
    *   **OCR/Data Extraction:** The `receipt_capture_screen.dart` currently displays static data. You need to implement a feature that allows users to capture an image of a receipt and then use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the relevant information (vendor, date, amount, etc.).
    *   **Data Persistence:** The extracted receipt data is not being saved anywhere. You need to implement a mechanism to store this data, either locally on the device or in a remote database.

### Medium Priority:

*   **Budget Analysis:**
    *   **Dynamic Data:** The `budget_analysis_screen.dart` is using hardcoded data from the `receipt_data.json` file. This should be replaced with dynamic data from the user's actual expenses.
    *   **Budget Creation/Management:** There is no way for users to create or manage their budgets. You need to add a feature that allows users to set budget limits for different categories.
*   **Categorized Expenses:**
    *   **Dynamic Data:** The `categorized_expenses_screen.dart` is also using hardcoded data. This should be replaced with dynamic data from the user's actual expenses.
    *   **Category Management:** There is no way for users to create, edit, or delete expense categories.
*   **Transaction History:**
    *   **Dynamic Data:** The `transaction_history_screen.dart` is using hardcoded data. This should be replaced with a list of the user's actual transactions.

### Low Priority:

*   **Settings:**
    *   **User Preferences:** The `settings_screen.dart` is currently empty. You can add options for users to customize the app, such as changing the theme, setting notification preferences, etc.
*   **Dashboard:**
    *   **Data Visualization:** The `dashboard_screen.dart` has a placeholder for a chart. You can implement a chart that visualizes the user's spending trends.
