**Objective:** To create a cross-platform (iOS/Android) Flutter application featuring an intelligent chat agent. This agent will be powered by a Gemini 2.5 Pro model hosted on Vertex AI and will provide personalized, data-driven responses by securely accessing user-specific information from a Firestore database. The user interface and overall functionality should be inspired by the Google Codelab for a "Personal Expense Assistant."

**Core Features:**
1.  **Agentic Chat Interface:** A user-friendly chat screen within the Flutter app.
2.  **Personalized Responses:** The chat agent must retrieve and utilize user data from Firestore to tailor its answers.
3.  **Secure Authentication:** Implement user authentication to ensure data privacy and security.
4.  **Backend Integration:** Seamlessly connect the Flutter frontend to the Vertex AI backend.

**Technical Stack:**
*   **Frontend:** Flutter SDK
*   **Backend:** Google Vertex AI (with Gemini 2.5 Pro)
*   **Database:** Google Firestore
*   **Cloud Functions (or similar):** A middleware layer to handle business logic, authentication, and communication between the app, Vertex AI, and Firestore.

**Proposed Architecture:**
1.  The Flutter application will handle the UI and user input.
2.  When a user sends a message, the app will make a secure API call (e.g., via a Cloud Function) to the backend.
3.  The backend service (e.g., Cloud Function) will receive the request. It will first authenticate the user and then fetch relevant user data from Firestore.
4.  The service will then invoke the Gemini model on Vertex AI, providing the user's query along with the retrieved Firestore data as context.
5.  The Gemini model will process the information and generate a relevant, personalized response.
6.  The response is sent back through the service to the Flutter app, which then displays it to the user.

**Implementation Plan & Key Tasks:**
1.  **Firestore Setup:** Define and structure the Firestore database schema for user data.
2.  **Backend Development:**
    *   Set up a new project on Google Cloud Platform.
    *   Create a service (e.g., using Cloud Functions for Firebase) to act as the intermediary.
    *   Implement logic within this service to:
        *   Authenticate requests from the Flutter app.
        *   Query the Firestore database.
        *   Make API calls to the Vertex AI Gemini model.
3.  **Flutter UI/UX Development:**
    *   Create the chat interface screen.
    *   Implement state management for the conversation history.
    *   Integrate the Firebase SDK for Flutter to handle authentication and communication with the backend service.
4.  **Integration & Testing:**
    *   Connect the Flutter app to the backend service.
    *   Perform end-to-end testing to ensure the entire flow is working correctly.
